## Course Description
A study of the design, use, and analysis of operating systems. The course will include a study of the supportive computer architecture, memory management, process management, information management, device control, operating systems structure, and evaluation.  
## Pre-Requisites

CMPS 231 Data Structures, CMPS 220 Assembly Language Programming, and MATH 237 Discrete Structures, CRWT 102 Crit. Reading & Writing 2 

## Course Materials

**Textbook** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Modern Operating Systems (4th Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-4th-Edition/dp/013359162X) by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Herbert Bos

*Note, the textbook is required for this course, and will be relavent to nearly each lecture.*

## Required Programming Environment
**Attention Microsoft Windows Users** - while we will touch upon the Win32 API, the vast majority of the programming you will do in this course will require you to write C++ code targeting the POSIX API, which is supported by Max OS X and Linux.  You will absolutely be required to program in the POSIX environment, so if you do not currently use OS X or Linux, you'll need to create an environment.  

If you are using Windows, you can install Linux alongside Windows without too much trouble.  You have a few options:

1. You could configure your computer to dual-boot into Windows or Linux.  This is an advanced option - please do so at your own risk!  I'd recommend using either Ubuntu or Linux Mint for easy installation.  I've provided some additional info on this [here](linux_install.html).
2. You could install Linux in a Virtual Machine, such as Virtual Box.  Again, you may choose any Linux distribution but I'd recommend Ubuntu or Mint if you are unfamiliar with Linux.
3.  The least *invasive* option is to simply install a small Linux environment accessible via the command line *while working in Windows*.  This is a great option if you've never used Linux before.  I've prepared detailed instructions, which can be found [here](vagrant.html).

## Course Objectives
* Understand and Program Processes & Threads
* Understand and Evaluate Scheduling / Synchronization / Deadlock algorithms
* Understand Memory Management and Paging Systems used in a typical OS
* Understand and Program with File Systems and understand their implementation
* Understand Security issues involved with an OS
* Understand and evaluate different problems associated with Distributed Systems and Networking
* Understand modern OS directions and trends 

## Lecture Schedule
Below is a tentative schedule for the course.  All topics and due dates are subject to change, and if there is a difference between what is stated here and on Moodle, please always consider Moodle to be correct (and let me know so I can correct the mismatch!).

**You must keep up with the readings** associated with each lecture.

## Written Report (WI Component)
Write a short research paper summarizing technical aspects of two popular mobile operating systems – iOS and Android.
* Report on technical aspects of their scheduling systems, thread design, IO / file systems, and security implementations.
* The papers are to be 3 pages in length (double spaced), with appropriate references.
* Due last class of semester

## Homework Assignments
Homework assignments are worth 100 points, and are turned in electronically.  

* [Homework 1](hw/hw1)  - Due on 9/9/15
* [Homework 2](hw/hw2)  - Due on 9/14/15
* [Homework 3](hw/hw3)  - Due on 9/23/15
* [Homework 4](hw/hw4)  - Due on 9/28/15
* [Homework 5](hw/hw5)  - Due on 10/14/15

## Late Policy
All assignments will be turned in electronically.  A late penalty of 5 points per day will be applied to all late assignments.  The required format/method of your electronic submissions will be outlined for each assignment.  Deviation from these requirements may result in a 5-point penalty.  

## Attendance Policy
Attendance will be recorded by the instructor and, along with class participation, will be a determining factor in making border-line final grade decisions

## Academic Integrity
Students are expected to read and understand Ramapo College’s Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found in the Ramapo College Catalog.  Members of the Ramapo College community are expected to be honest and forthright in their academic endeavors.  Students who are suspected of violating this policy will be referred to the Office of the Provost.

### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY SPECIFIC TO THIS COURSE  
For programming assignments (Homework Assignments), you may discuss ideas, however you may not allow others to see your source code or examine others’.  Sharing of source code is extremely easy to detect and is strictly prohibited.  

IF SHARING OF SOURCE CODE IS SUSPECTED, INTENTIONAL OR OTHERWISE, BOTH PARTIES WILL IMMEDIATELY BE REFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST.
